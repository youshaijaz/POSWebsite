            </h5>
            <p>An estimated 1.2 million children are trafficked every year. Children are targeted <br>
               due to their vulnerability, often ending up in forced labor, domestic servitude, armed conflict, <br>
               or the sex trade. This is not just a problem in one country — it's a global <br>
               crisis affecting millions of lives.

      <h1>Example case 2</h1>
      <h2>Operation Baby Broker” (2000s) – Brazil</h2>
      <br>
      <h4>What happened: </h4>
      <p>This was an international trafficking ring where Brazilian babies were illegally sold to families in Europe, especially Italy and the U.S.
      </p>
      <h4>Tactics:</h4>
      <p>Mothers were paid or tricked into giving up their babies; false paperwork made the adoptions appear legal.
      </p>
      <h4>Outcome:</h4>
      <p>Brazilian and international authorities arrested several lawyers, doctors, and notary officials.
